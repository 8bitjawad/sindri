**Sindri — Local Service Booking Platform**

Sindri is a Django-based “Uber for local services” — a platform that connects people with nearby carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and other skilled professionals in just a few clicks.

**The Problem**

If you live in the UAE, you’ve probably faced this:
Getting in touch with a reliable carpenter or plumber isn’t as easy as it should be.

Unless you live in a building that already provides maintenance — which often comes with higher rent and less flexibility — you’re left relying on random WhatsApp numbers, word-of-mouth recommendations, or expensive agencies.

There’s no simple, trustworthy system for finding, booking, and reviewing local service providers — especially for small, one-time jobs.

**The Solution**

Sindri aims to make this process simple and transparent.

🧰 Customers can browse local services, book a provider, track booking status, and leave reviews — all from one dashboard.

🔧 Service Providers can list their services, manage bookings, and view performance analytics.

⚙️ A Django-powered backend ensures smooth authentication, booking management, and secure data handling.

**Why “Sindri”?**

In Norse mythology, Sindri is the dwarf who forged powerful artifacts for the gods — symbolizing craftsmanship, reliability, and skill.
This project embodies that same spirit: empowering local professionals and making their expertise more accessible.
